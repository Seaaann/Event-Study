# Event-study during pedemic
## A simple research with a simple idea
This researh downloaded data from yahoo finance, so it is very friendly for those who require data. As you know, it is very time-consuming to find data.
I skip most of economic theories, only left some necessary formulas.
To diversify and to compare, let's look at Chinese listed companies on the US market and the US listed companies. The companies are across industries.
The offical time that both countries declare the emergency is different. It is somewhat avoiding overlapping problem but not all.
The aim is to see if the selected companies' stock returns see a dramatic drop (or jump) at the time of the event happens or during the event period (window).


## Some statistic basics
We need t-statistic to test the significance of abnormal return (if it is significantly different from 0).
$$
t = \frac{abnormal return}{\frac{\simga}{\sqrt{n}}}
$$
